Hi,

To make edits to the class diagram, there are a few steps you need to follow:

1. Create your own dev-branch if you haven't!
2. Load the XML file into Visual Paradigm. Open the program file, and find 'Import' in one of the tabs.
3. Edit!

Once you are done editing, there are a few steps you need to follow:

1. Export the project as an XML file. This is to ensure backward compatibility.
2. Export the class diagram as a PNG image. This can be done using the 'Active diagram as image' function under Export.
3. Push the changes to your remote dev-branch and inform the team!

:)
