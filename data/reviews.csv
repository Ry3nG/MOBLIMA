"_Terrifier 2_ is a massive improvement over its parent film but doesn't quite do enough to move the needle for me. From the get-go, this films tone and quality is drastically superior to the previous entry. The writing gives characters room to develop, and audiences can actually grow attached to characters in way that was blatantly absent from the first film. I enjoyed the added lore for Art that was sprinkled throughout, adds a level of depth to the newly founded horror icon. The writing allows for much more creative kills and set pieces, with the story taking place across an entire town rather than one claustrophobic apartment building. But with all those improvements, there are still lingering problems that carried over from the first film. Actor performances were all over the board. Some actresses were really compelling and honestly shocked me for the indie type feel of the film. Some notable highlights for me were the lead actress _Lauren LaVera_, _Kailey Hyman_, and _Elliott Fullam_. But other performances were legitimately bad, it felt like I was watching a high school drama production. There are some major pacing problems, for starters this movie is almost 2.5 hours long. There is no need for a runtime this long, there is so much fluff in here that it really bogs down the flow of the film. This movie does a better job of adding suspense to its scenes but is too reliant on blood and gore to get its gasps from the audience. I normally am one to appreciate when a movie goes above and beyond in the gore department, but this movie went overboard. So many scenes had be physically ill due to the graphic content. Sometimes less is more and that is for sure the case here. Despite its flaws, this is a great next step for this small-time studio and with the success at the box office there will surely be a sequel where Dameon Leone has the opportunity to craft a real top notch horror film.**Score:** _63%_ |**Verdict:** _Decent_",Nathan,6,663712,634e9e33d100b6007f94eae6,9395a224-f475-4cfd-bd87-60ee0111a7c7
"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/black-adam-spoiler-free-reviewBlack Adam is far from impressive, being somewhat disappointing due to its formulaic, predictable screenplay when something different was anticipated.Lorne Balfe's epic score and a magnificent cast - Dwayne Johnson, Aldis Hodge, and most remarkably Pierce Brosnan are phenomenal - try to elevate the decent action and visuals, but the moderate entertainment levels don't make up for the dated narrative structure.Tiresomely heavy exposition, story with little to no creativity, and inconsistent humor make it impossible for the DCEU to take the next step in a truly impactful manner.Rating: C+",MSB,5,436270,63501e9ed363e5007a664110,78cd6605-6bb4-43fe-8f5f-7e99b4e1c303

"With a horrid script, lackluster performances, and a waste of potentially awesome characters, _Black Adam_ is an explosive, $195 million, anti-heroic dud. The DCEU is about to get way more convoluted and underwhelming than ever before if this is the future of live action DC films.**Full review:** https://hubpages.com/entertainment/Black-Adam-20220-Review-A-Stale-and-Disjointed-Antihero-Kerfuffle",Chris Sawin,3,436270,6354b267c9dbf9008237a4b1,4660527f-0e25-4d4d-9ca4-30639ad6ca98
"**Black Adam might not reinvent the wheel, but it doesn’t have to. It just wants to take you on a fun, entertaining, exciting superhero ride!**Black Adam has its haters, and I can understand why. It doesn’t necessarily break new ground in the superhero genre, but that doesn’t stop it from being awesome! Action-packed from start to finish. The effects are incredible. I kept myself from saying Wow out loud on multiple occasions. Dwayne Johnson’s Black Adam is absolutely ruthless, ripping armies of henchmen with ease and speed. I was worried a PG-13 rating might soften his brutality, but it did not! The action sequences looked amazing and were well done. I really liked the Justice Society characters, although they all felt a little stereotypical with a SpiderMan jokester, a wise old Professor X, and a quipping leader in the vain of Wolverine or Deadshot. Pierce Brosnan was perfect at Dr. Fate, making me wish he hadn’t been relegated to special guest star status. The movie didn’t waste a ton of time giving background on each character which was wise with so many new heroes on screen. The film had its moments of cheese but didn’t overdo it. Definitely watch the mid-credit scene. It’s stupendous! Black Adam was a fine addition to the superhero genre, and I look forward to what comes next.",mooney240,8,436270,6354c7b5a843c1007d88ed93,1538b278-0625-4866-ab27-aa3312556aaa
"> _My powers are not a gift. They're a curse, born out of rage._I had a blast watching this in theaters. This was very bombastic, with a lot of cool action, but also telling a heartfelt story about Black Adam.It was very inventive how they depicted Black Adam's origin, keeping it a mystery up near the end. Dwayne Johnson was born to play Black Adam. He steals every scene he's in playing a badass anto-hero.Now the Justice Society, while they didn't have a backstory in the film, they each had prequel comics detailing their backstory. Which I really dig, these comics are meant to sell comics, after all. Might as well get the audience to buy the comics to get into some great stories (they are also currently doing this with The Flash). The movie actually starts right where the Doctor Fate prequel comic ends, so I don't think it's apographa. Doctor Fate played by Pierce Brosnan was a standout. He really put his all into this character. Aldis Hodge was also a standout as Hawkman.The surprise villain of Black Adam, Sabbac, was a really good addition to the Shazam! mythos. If the wizards have their own champion, why doesn't the seven deadly sins have one? Sabbac is the answer to that. Doctor Fate's battle with him was really cool.Overall, this wasn't as bad as the critics were saying, I had a fun time! Be sure to stay for the mid-credits scene!",jwilliams0511971,8,436270,6355f462f8e98200817bfb30,a1f1b0f6-45a5-4f5a-8d61-dd587d6f9b55

"In search of the all powerful crown of Sabbac, Adrianna (Sarah Shahi) unleashes Seth-Adam (Dwayne Johnson) from his mountain-encased tomb deep in the desert. With super-human powers akin to Superman, he returns to his home city of Kahndaq which is under the control of the Intergangs. Will he decide to help her and her son Amon (Bodhi Sabongui) free them from this criminal tyranny? Well what nobody had counted on are the folks from the Justice League/Brotherhood/Department - led by Hawkman (Aldis Hodge) and Dr. Fate (Pierce Brosnan) who have decided that Adam is a bit of an wrong-un and so bring their state-of-the-art rocket ship as well as the Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo) and Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell) to capture or destroy him. Thing is, Adam is the stuff of legend to these people - reputedly having defeated an ancient despotic king - but is/was he all that he seemed? Is he good or evil or both? Well, to be honest I didn't really care. This is a very well produced and technically superb creative effort, but the story is all over the place and the repetitive combat scenes just grate after a while. Johnson has charisma, we have seen it loads of times, but here he exudes none. Hodge looks great in his winged-suit but again, his character is as deep as an Ethiopian river in July. Centineo has some fun as the giant - more than a passing resemblance to Mark Ruffalo, don't you think? Otherwise the rest of this is about as derivative as it comes. Hopefully this is just a one-off, as this is nobody's finest work and is up there with Morbius as a superhero film too many!",CinemaSerf,6,436270,63578b5aefd3c200907b78fd,801dae46-8fe1-42cd-9909-1376dbf7a90a
"_Black Adam_ is in every aspect a generic superhero movie. There is nothing that really separates this for me, besides the body count that Black Adam stacks up during the film.One thing I need to mention is the audio quality. So many lines of dialogue sound like they were recorded straight off from a cell phone. They do not match the scene at all and it was incredibly jarring throughout the entirety of the film. While I am talking about sound, in almost every fight scene the film included a badass rap song. It was cool the first time, but it got old and corny fast.The plot was very generic from all aspects. It suffers by trying to catch the audience up in the first act. The film introduces the Justice Society and Black Adam and quickly accelerates the plot to start the main conflict of the film. It felt rushed and the conflict between the JSA and Black Adam was forced, nothing about it felt genuine. The villian in this movie was so forgettable, by the time he is introduced the conflict is over. I had zero emotional attachment to anyone in this movie. The dialogue was pretty bad as well, the scenes constantly switched from serious to comedy causing both aspects to fall flat for me.The performances were okay, everyone was pretty average including Dwayne Johnson. Nothing spectacular and nothing bad enough for me to notice.Overall, I was excited for this new phase and direction of the DCEU and was left disappointed. Definitely one of the poorer movies in the franchise.**Score:** _48%_ |**Verdict:** _Average_",Nathan,5,436270,635800e9d18fb9007ab4a9fe,426604cb-622c-438f-b831-c01cdcd312db
"A fascinating film with potential that was never fully achieved. “All Quiet on the Western Front” does not rely solely on shock value to disturb its audience; instead, it uses the horrors of war to sober them with facts and dismal realities. The film's story was worth telling; it left an impression long after the credits rolled. It dealt with many weighty themes, including a young man's journey through war, the difficulties of combat, the cruelty of desperation, and the value of friendship and camaraderie, all of which were handled with grace and artistry. Furthermore, it boasted first-rate production values, breathtaking visuals, a terrific score (although maybe a tad bit over the top), and stellar acting. Although there is much to praise about the film, “All Quiet on the Western Front” is ultimately hampered by its drawn-out length, the plot dragging in spots, and several confusing moments. All the pieces were in place for “All Quiet on the Western Front” to be the best picture of the year, and in some respects, it is. Fans of the genre, or anyone who appreciates a well-made film, should not miss this film despite its limitations.___Rating: ***7.5/10*** *(Impressive, yet it doesn't quite hit the mark in every respect)*",Ahmad,7,49046,6361e85c5900861109817e1c,51c86548-3121-4c5c-b490-a83beef25cca
"**Wakanda Forever was an earnest film that tackled some tough themes and honored its hero well but got bogged down introducing vast new worlds and complicated characters.**Wakanda Forever left me with mixed emotions. The respect and love paid to the legacy of Chadwick Boseman were heartfelt, meaningful, and sincere. The movie wisely grappled with the aftermath of T’Challa’s passing on his family and nation. This subject matter created excellent opportunities to dive deeper into characters like Shuri, Nakia, and even M’Baku. Instead, Wakanda Forever primarily served as a vehicle to introduce Namor and Talokan. The film rightfully embraced a more somber tone as it dealt with themes of loss and legacy, but the mournful spirit caused the plot to sag and drag along throughout most of the runtime. Winston Duke offers the little levity the movie had. The cast delivered exceptionally, with Angela Bassett’s performance as the true standout. I liked the movie, but the melancholy approach made it more difficult to really enjoy, and the introduction of Namor and his threat to Wakanda chewed up so much of the story that it was difficult to bring closure to characters struggling with loss and heartbreak satisfyingly.",mooney240,7,505642,636de2bdd4653700b44daee9,90c39f99-3d80-4a87-9982-6088ea5859c5
"Even if the story was kind of lackluster, the film itself was incredible.  If you consider the tower as a kind of true main character of the movie.  On first watching this I can instantly imagine the blustering cacophony of outrage about climbing technique from viewers.  From the first, the film is rather jarring but honest about its juvenile depiction of climbing.  At the start I had to decide NOT to care about how realistic it was because it would be wrong to reduce a film abductio absurdum because it is a story after all.  A creation.  It isn't being judged on its ability to remind one of real life so much as to forget it.  I do this 'forgetting' voluntarily and I seem to enjoy films more. I felt my body constricting away slightly and getting anxious during the gravity yawning scenes, 2000ft above the ground!  The characters were reckless enough to believe they would die at almost any time.  It was unrelenting in the tension.  Even if the writing is kind of silly at times, there are elements in a film, perhaps shown through other mediums besides the writing itself that can raise the score of the film quite a bit. Consider the cinematography.  The deft and skilled work at showing the tension existing in every moment by rattling bolts in close up with uncanny metallic sounds protesting the extra weight.  The drone shots that highlight the mind bending fear of such a radical location.   Honestly!  It seemed like such a labor of love of the filmmakers.  They immediately saw how much could be done with the location.  The story felt like a vehicle for the film which was this awesome gigantic testament to the fear of heights.  The movie poster sold this one for me because I was thinking, well, even if it isn't that good, the idea itself is good enough to be fascinating.  Consider the main character of the movie: the tower itself.  It said nothing the entire time, but it was the star of every scene.   Such as it was, the story was like kind of this extra fluff that you had to deal with, but what a cool film.  There was an amazing number of times I was 'triggered' by how silly and unrealistic the climbing aspects were, and how insanely reckless it became.  However, I don't believe that anyone thinks this a film to be studying climbing from.  It isn't even showing climbing's artistic nature which is the film's biggest pitfall.  I loved how the arc centered around conquering your fears through this metaphorical path of climbing and I'm sure a lot of climbers embraced that, and were reminded of it, but it was a crime to leave out why the characters are pursuing this passion.",ObjectivityGate,7,985939,631145261511aa0080d77496,ad7f9109-8875-4573-b1ac-2ad70eed9eca
"**Fall is 47 Meters Down but with heights instead of depths - 47 Meters Up.**Fall keeps your stomach in your throat with its dizzying heights and anxiety-inducing peril. The movie’s plot is extremely thin, but that’s what you would expect from a film with this premise. Grace Curry and Virginia Gardner’s despair seemed authentic through their convincing performances. Panic and distress filled every shot as the camera soaked in the unbelievable heights and endless landscapes. Scott Mann once again directs an emotional suspense-laden film that feels incredibly similar to 47 Meters Down, even borrowing an identical plot twist. Fall stretched on a little longer than needed, but I appreciated the staggering suspense and character development that elevated a meager concept to vertigo-inducing heights.",mooney240,7,985939,6311aa49e78687007f5a95ff,c71a5600-a4b2-4376-8fa9-f9e908b0f45f
"Fall is a sweaty palms, nerve racking ride, that plays, with gleeful sadism, on one the most basic and widespread, of human fears.An Acrophobic's worst nightmare, Fall takes a very basic premise and uses it to good effect, building a primal, instinctively terrifying, anxiety soaked action flick, of quite literally, dizzying heights. This is, somewhat antithetically, both an easy and hard watch rolled into one. I frequently found myself holding my breath, tensing, jumping and having to take breaks to get over my own sense of fear, at what I was witnessing. I was heavily invested in the main characters, wanting to see them safely escape their horrible predicament, in spite of their reckless decision to climb an obviously rusted, dilapidated tower. In short, great edge of your seat stuff. Just goes to show how much can be achieved with a modest budget and a lot of inspiration.",MovieGuys,7,985939,631473fdc048a9008fe9cdef,39dfe256-ea86-4cde-a625-e81159662d29
"Right. First things first. Understood that you erect a 2000ft television relay tower back in the day, but when that industry moves to satellite delivery, why on Earth would anyone just leave this gradually rusting structure standing - only for it to come crashing down one day when the metal fatigue has won out? Hmmm! Anyway, luckily for us the planner's ineptitude allowed for Becky (Grace Caroline Currey) and her friend Hunter (Virginia Gardner) to go climb it. It's quite a big deal for the former woman - she had been free-climbing almost one year earlier with her friend and her husband Dan (Mason Gooding) when disaster struck and she has spent much of the intervening period married to Jack Daniels. Scorning any sensible planning - food, gloves etc. up they go - there is a ladder - and are soon at the top surveying the immensity of the view. Time to go down, the ladder gives way. The two are lucky to have the platform right at the top to take refuge on, but their bag - water and drone contained within - falls 50 feet and balances precariously on a redundant satellite dish below. What's to do? The plot really does take a quite cynical turn when they fire a flare to attract the attention of some men in a nearby camper van, only for the guys to spot them and then proceed to steal their car! Otherwise, this is really just a remarkable feat of photography that certainly had my palms sweating. Director Scott Mann and the cinematographer (MacGregor) do manage to effectively draw us into the two friend's predicament and if you are even vaguely acrophobic, then this film can be a really tough watch at times. Sadly, though, in the search for characterisation we discover that even at altitude, there is a place for a rather tiresome melodrama. Thereafter it is quite difficult to warm to either of the women who are being harried by some hungry buzzards as they perch! The ending is not good. To be fair, it isn't straightforward either, it has a few quirks to keep us on our toes - but they are not terribly realistic quirks. Enjoy is not the correct word for this film - I cannot say I was too relaxed for much of my time in the cinema tonight, but if this is to be seen at all, then it does need that big screen. On television it will lose much of it's photographic impact and that really is all this film is worth watching for - the acting and repetitive Are you OK? dialogue leaves much to be desired.",CinemaSerf,6,985939,63152562d40d4c007ab0c72c,cbf7db7b-1849-4ceb-9581-5e163e296342
"**might contain spoilers**What a great murder mystery film. As an amateur climber, I too was initially put off by the amount of unprofessional climbing techniques. However, if they were truly climbing/solo enthusiasts, how could they not get injured way before they take on any big challenges? (And from a filmmaking perspective, with climbing being such a popular sports, surly it is not hard to get some random joe from the gym to tell the film crew that those techniques are horrible! also there are other suspicious common-sense defying points later…) The answer of course, what we watched is just simply a **recounting of Becky’s version of what transpired!!!** Then all the inaccuracies makes perfect sense as that’s how you get the authorities to believe why the “accidents” happened in the first place — sheer negligence and amateur skills!I believe what happened was that Becky found out that she was cheated on, then plotted to get rid of the asshat by either screwing with the cam placements and/or - as filmed but with a malignant intent - to get rid of the rope too liberally. And no one else knows exactly how good the cam placements are or whether they were tempered with - Hunter is way above them busy down-climbing!Then, this explains perfectly her year-long depression as even if not fully planned out, her imo premeditated actions naturally put herself in even deeper sense of guilt.Then there’s the forever unknowable fact that whether the tower trips is truly initiated by Hunter. Possibly Becky saw Hunter is living a guilt-free life and had another urge for murder and proposed to feed Hunter this great youtube/instagram clickbait trip to convince her to come along! Although the film depicts that Hunter is very heartwarming at times, it’s entirely plausible that Hunter **is** in fact the care-free personality that she demonstrates in **all her videos online!** (which might makes her more murderable in Becky’s eye). So Becky could be using a very high-IQ way of framing her victims as compassionate sweethearts.Finally, the biggest telltale sign that the final accident is premeditated (and possibly intended by the filmcrew/writer) is that when Becky lastly went for Hunter’s body to drop down the phone, she **instinctively — rightfully so for a climber** clipped the carabiner to the lowest stable point which is the as yet unbroken ladder!!!(and the film gave this a real good close-up) Why on earth wouldn’t Hunter do that when she went down to retrieve the bag???!!! This is not just bad climbing, this defies common sense! We were all screaming how stupid it was of Hunter to do what she did in the bag sequence and now we know, **these are all extremely likely fabrications recounted by Becky at the end of the accident!**Lastly, some keen chinese filmgoers also noted the “mistake” on the poster where in fact **the ladders are failing while Becky’s at the top and Hunter is still climbing!** Maybe this is a hint from the production team ;)**welp anyways it’s just a theory :p I probably watched too many asian sope-operas**",Feng,8,985939,631f6fcb0bb076009286f13a,77f661dc-98de-421d-8707-88fb2f62123e
"I can’t help having a soft spot for a movie that name-drops several pro wrestlers as a means to convey a nice bit of subtle foreshadowing, and plays Warrants «Cherry Pie» on its soundtrack like every five minutes.On the other hand, it’s very difficult to empathize with the characters in this film; anyone who climbs a rusty, super creaky 2,000 foot TV tower (a choice so inane that under normal circumstances it’s known as the Fallacy of the Climbing Villain) in the middle of bumfuck nowhere just for shits and giggles deserves whatever’s coming to them. The rationale, such as it is, behind the protagonists’ actions is that life is «too short» and «you gotta do something that makes you feel alive.» Methinks they’re confusing joie de vivre with having a fucking death wish. According to these people’s logic, Bobby De Niro and Chris Walken were really sucking the marrow out of life in those Russian roulette scenes from The Deer Hunter.  Now, that climbing artificial structures (known as buildering as well as several other names) is a reckless (not to mention illegal) thing to do doesn’t necessarily mean that those who do it take it lightly. I’m sure a lot of planning and prepping and getting in shape mentally and physically (even the relatively simple act of climbing a ladder becomes a Herculean labor when the ladder is twice as tall as the Eiffel Tower) precedes the actual deed.We don’t see any of that here; not even a training montage. For Hunter (Virginia Gardner) and Becky (Grace Caroline Currey) it’s an overnight decision; sure, Hunter says she’s has «planned» it, and she’s some sort of daredevil You Tuber, but Becky is an out-of-practice rock climber who has ostensibly become a drunken slob in the year since her husband’s Disney Villain Death. All of the above notwithstanding, the film certainly makes the most of its chosen setting. The landscape around the top of the tower (consisting of a «pizza-size platform») betrays a green screen quality to it, but this is a rare occasion in which this actually works in the movie’s favor; at such dizzying heights, wouldn’t the world and everything in it look surreal? Or, to put it more bluntly, wouldn’t your perception get all screwed up? Moreover, the stunts don’t flat-out take your breath away, but they do kind of borrow it for a little while, which is better than nothing; also, there’s a certain measure of suspense regarding whether or not help is on the way — and while this is the only movie that I can think of where the audience is left literally waiting for the other shoe to drop, this aspect of the plot actually involves a pretty neat shot of, well, a shoe dropping.",JPRetana,4,985939,63216caf87a27a0085bc6385,56db3506-3aef-4702-a098-7b6849345db2
"**_Fall_** is a survival thriller that succeeds, at least for those of us with the fear of heights, to get an uneasy feeling with the aerial shots. The visual effects used to do those scenes were fairly well done and even though it is a movie with two (naïve) climbers being stuck on top of a tower, the film co-scripted and directed by Scott Mann still was quite entertaining. The performances from both Grace Caroline Currey and Virginia Gardner were well done (Jeffrey Dean Morgan only had a couple minutes of screen time and likely did this as a favor to Mann as the pair previously worked together on 2015’s Heist).**_Fall_** isn’t a movie I’d watch again, not unlike many other of these survival thrillers (like 47 Meters Down, Shallows, 127 Hours), but it’s still well worth a watch especially on a Friday or Saturday night with nothing else that might catch your eye.As a side, apparently this was shot for an R-rating with numerous f-bombs which were dubbed over once Lionsgate was distributing and in one scene the replacement of two f-bombs with “fricking” was pretty laughable. **3.75/5**",JPV852,7,985939,6343af7f39a1a6008442c82b,d124011a-8123-4bca-a7ed-15a1846db2e4

Its premise automatically brings high levels of adrenaline, suspense, and tension - especially for acrophobes - and Scott Mann achieves the ideal mix of realism and absurdity.It doesn't go overboard to the point of causing countless eye rolls, nor is it too generic and inconsequential, adding a rather impactful narrative twist near the third act.

"OK, so this is about as derivative as it is possible to get - but you know what, I actually quite enjoyed it. It's a short and sweet tale of the young Evie (Nathalie Emmanuel). She does one of those online DNA tests and before she knows it, is having a posh lunch with Oliver (Hugh Skinner) - a posh British lad who claims that she is his long lost cousin. After about thirty seconds, she is invited to come to Yorkshire for a wedding and, as you would - readily accepts. Upon arrival, she encounters their irascible butler Fields (Sean Pertwee) and then the hunky lord of the manor Walt (Thomas Doherty). She is smitten, indeed they are at it within twenty four hours - but soon she starts to sense that things at the new Carfax Manor are not quite what they may seem - not least because there is a distinct lack of bride and groom; and the waitresses employed to cater for the occasion have a habit of disappearing. What could be going on...? Well, it's fairly clear to us from the start who the baddie is, and that Viktoria (a sort of Angelina Jolie-esque Stephanie Corneliussen) and her pal Lucy (Alana Boden) are in on the cunning scheme too. It has clearly been done on a limited budget, but the direction is still just about adequate. The story, though, is pretty thin and the acting is drama school stuff for the most part before an ending that really does let the whole thing down rather badly. Still, I watched it with considerable trepidation in a pretty empty cinema, and left thinking it passed 100-odd minutes amiably enough. Not great, no - but not rubbish either.",CinemaSerf,6,830788,630c3bcd1f0275007b2f5a90,6eb7f06e-571f-40c5-8d5b-5d3cc4eb7da1
"**The Invitation wastes great potential and ideas by trying too hard to be clever and failing.**Reviews for The Invitation are mediocre at best but as harsh as they seem, they aren't too far off. The Invitation takes the successes of Ready or Not and blends them with the Dracula story putting a fresh new take on a familiar story. The film benefits from this new approach and introduces new characters and ideas. But that is where the good runs out. The first hour of the runtime forces a romance between the heroine and a painfully suspicious and uncomfortable forward rich guy. Unfortunately, the story gets so caught up in trying to fool the audience into thinking it is a simple romance movie, so it could shock with the vampire twist that it didn't leave time to make the conclusion feel rewarding or earned. Once the monsters finally revealed themselves, The Invitation sprinted to the end, with the inexperienced heroine easily besting Dracula and his minions; corrupt families and monsters had survived and thrived for hundreds of years. The victory sadly does not convince or satisfy. If The Invitation had spent less time on the failed love story and more time developing the vampire story, this could have been a good movie.",mooney240,6,830788,63256338244182007f8d48f9,15afbcd5-f052-41d4-bcce-122a5c519356
"_The Invitation_ started off so well, but eventually morphed into a generic film that I could have predicted from a mile away. The set up to the movie was decent, but the second act was when I really thought this movie nailed it. I really enjoyed the somewhat sadistic back and forth between the two leads. On one hand, you see a woman ready to give herself over to the thought of love for the first time. While on the other hand, the audience knows this chance at love is built on a lie. Despite this fact, I found the chemistry incredibly strong between the two leads. I was smiling as their love story progressed, even though I knew it was not going to end well. Nathalie Emmanuel and Thomas Doherty do such an excellent job in this film. I loved their chemistry and Dohery does such a great Jekyll and Hyde with the unearthly vampire masked by the charismatic lord. Super entertaining watching them do great work here.The creepy disturbing nature of the trailers was not overly present here, almost all of the unsettling imagery was used for the trailers and leaves the rest of the movie feeling pretty generic. This is even more evident when the movie turns into a vampire action flick reminiscent of the Twilight movies. At this moment, I was completely ripped out of the movie and was ready for it to end. This drastic change in tone really did not fit well here for me. Even though the last quarter was a disappointment, there is still good elements to the movie that is worth watching for those that were initially interested.**Score:** _55%_ |**Verdict:** _Average_",Nathan,5,830788,6349a2d9688cd0008134efaf,f215d117-8c32-4bc2-8e3d-e05dfd463a49
"Say what you will, the original Jeeper's Creepers films, especially the first one, were master classes in budget horror.Everything that came after, hasn't lived up to the original. Jeepers Creepers Reborn, is, for my money, just another off the shelf, rather mediocre, knock off. The story largely overlooks the factors that made the original film, so compellingly chilling. The slowly building tension, the gradual realisation that the pursuer is something worse than a garden house variety serial killer. In other words, the film creeps up on you. This film plays more like a run of the mill slasher flick, without the jump scares. The results not frightening or even a little chilling. I'd describe everything else as alright, from acting, sets through to horror effects.In summary, this one failed to resonate with me. I do not feel it came even close, to recapturing the essence of what made the original Creeper films disturbing cult icons of horror.",MovieGuys,4,717728,633ded7f21118f007dce7dc8,6f046f69-f671-4679-83b6-0ec03a13395e

"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/enola-holmes-2-spoiler-free-reviewEnola Holmes 2 maintains the levels of light, adventurous fun of the original, surpassing it due to a much more cohesive, intriguing central narrative, in addition to overall better pacing. The different storylines mesh together nicely, and Harry Bradbeer's distinctive visual style remains a standout.Millie Bobby Brown shines as Enola, as does Henry Cavill as Sherlock - the latter even too much, sometimes stealing the spotlight from a female-empowered story partially based on a real event with a significant impact on the evolution of women's rights.Highly recommend it as a weekend viewing.Rating: B",MSB,7,829280,63657e2f9020120079487f88,57b4be17-3154-4eb8-af76-55cd4f8bc356
"What an excellent sequel - I, in fact, like it more than its predecessor.<em>'Top Gun: Maverick'</em> is fantastic, simply put. I was expecting it to be good, but it's actually much more enjoyable than I had anticipated. The callbacks to the original are expertly done, the new characters are strong/well cast, it has plenty of meaning, music is fab and the action is outstanding - the aerial stuff is sensational.The story is superb, with each high stake coming across as intended - parts even gave me slight goosebumps, which is a surprise given I'm not someone who has a connection to the 1986 film. It's all super neatly put together, I honestly came close to giving it a higher rating.Tom Cruise is brilliant as he reprises the role of Maverick, while Miles Teller comes in and gives a top performance. Jennifer Connelly is another positive, though her role does kinda feel a tiny bit forced in order to have a love interest; given Kelly McGillis' [unexplained] absence.Monica Barbaro stands out most from the fresh faces, though I actually did enjoy watching them all - which is something I thought the film may struggle with, adding new people, but it's done nicely; sure Jon Hamm and Glen Powell are a little cliché, though overall I approve.A great watch - I'd highly recommend it, though naturally would suggest watching the previous film first if you haven't already.",r96sk,9,361743,628e79eb1a32483b62466c62,d0f03dbf-f672-4d2d-8949-76f63471d39c
"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/top-gun-maverick-spoiler-free-reviewTop Gun: Maverick is the return of pure, nostalgic blockbusters, instantly becoming one of this year's personal favorites. The best aerial action sequences ever amaze even the highest expectations, not only due to the absolutely insane real stunts but largely because of the flawless contribution of all filmmaking elements.The surprisingly emotional screenplay helps Tom Cruise deliver one of the best performances of his career. Perfect editing is essential to creating such realism, as well as raising the tension levels for one of the best final acts within the respective genre.And, finally, the memorable score loaded with epic tracks makes the theater experience the only way this magnificent work should be seen.Superior to the original in every way.Rating: A-",MSB,9,361743,6291388cd48cee0f2ab6246f,fa33c108-e81e-47fd-9f6b-84c2de79712c
"A lot of things in this movie do not make sense, like why not use F-35?, why didn't cruise missiles target enemy air defence and planes in hangars? to name a few. The original movie had some seriousness built into it, the sequel I think is closer to a comic book movie. Very similar to the original star wars, especially the action sequence at the end. Just a tad more realistic than black widow, you can clearly see the action comedy style of Marvel movies.I think a lot of conservatives reminiscing Reagan years would watch it, that should be enough to make it a hit.I think that is also the reason of the high score. To me the movie quality is more of 5 ~ 7 out of 10.Just don't think too much when watching it, but I don't think that is too big a problem for the target audience.",tmdb20895531,5,361743,629181017d5db510a72f8efc,13ea252b-58e1-493d-80d4-1582d175c9a2
"It seems like I have been watching the trailers for this film for years now - and you know what? Yes - it was worth the wait. The film is all about some truly exhilarating aerial photography that culminates in some super dogfighting and a good old dose of nostalgia. Tom Cruise is very much in his element as the ageing - and frequently not afraid to look it - eponymous Top Gun pilot drafted in by a rather sceptical admiral to train up a new squad for a very perilous mission to destroy an underground uranium enrichment facility. The team arrive - full of hormones - and he must whip them into shape, a task made more difficult by the presence of Rooster (Miles Teller) who is the son of his old mate Goose who came to a sticky end last time out in 1986. He also gets to rekindle his romance with bar owner Penny (Jennifer Connelly) whilst all under the protection of his former wingman, now the poorly retired admiral Kazansky (Val Kilmer). To be honest, the story isn't really up to much - there are some twists and turns, the script is not without some humour but there is no jeopardy really. We all know what is going to happen in the end. That said, though, everyone is on good form; the pace (aside from the interludes with Connelly which do rather abruptly slow things down a bit) is consistently action packed and the imagery from both inside and outside of these amazing pieces of machinery is not at all repetitive and is compelling to watch. Even the usual gung-ho, ye-ha stuff is kept to a minimum - this is a superior film depicting the US military at it's most competitive, but also at it's most intelligent - and I really quite enjoyed it. Big screen photography - don't wait til it is on the telly.",CinemaSerf,7,361743,629470aca44d090067b777ba,1e9d13d2-5e33-4c41-bbcf-660d035a54d1
"_Top Gun: Maverick_ is a sequel that is a leaps and bounds improvement over the original film. There’s better acting from the entire cast, more of an emotional attachment between at least two of the main characters in the film, and subtle humor that actually lands. But the film’s constant need to fly in the same flight pattern as the original film comes off as more of a restraint than a fond recollection.The sequel seems to highlight many of the shortcomings of the original film, which in retrospect seems like something you’d try to avoid. With its record breaking box office during Memorial Day weekend, _Top Gun: Maverick_ is an enormously thrilling sequel with unparalleled action sequences that has proven to be exactly what fans have been waiting over 30 years for.**Full review:** https://hubpages.com/entertainment/Top-Gun-Maverick-2022-Review-Dont-Think-Just-Sequel",Chris Sawin,6,361743,6298c0207e12f02c82337cbb,18a26178-0aae-4a0a-9698-ec2c4ea7e10c
"Haven't seen a movie this perfect in decades. It was most obviously written and directed with the audience in mind - no politics, no preaching, no gratuitous sex, no woke, no offensive casting or characters. Brilliant, simplistic screenwriting and thrill rides. The original, if you've seen it, was iconic as it was, and to know it makes the second film here more enjoyable, but even if you're not familiar with the background of the characters it's clearly presented enough to be a stand-alone enjoyable film.",JustEntertainment,10,361743,62b0614f568463006125f78a,f86500f8-e058-42e2-a599-f65367eca0c7

Everything about this film is polished. It comfortably updates the 80's original with style, verve and hands down top shelf acting from Tom Cruise and the cast.I'm not a fan of NATO or US exceptionalism but this films such quality, it even had me cheering, irrespective.Entertainment as it should be.....10/10.",MovieGuys,10,361743,62fc861b7cffda0092ddb40c,14e7ab11-aec1-4944-b7e8-8763829172d7

This movie doesnt have any complex story and some of it structure if im looking at it, kinda almost the same as the first one.

Damn it feels good hearing that theme again... and also, i want to applause Onerepublic and Lady Gaga for creating such an awesome soundtrack for the movieNow lastly for cinematography and visual effect, its probably the first time in my life i got out from IMAX and said i paid 10$ dollar for this movie? i feel like i should've paid more. This movie is too good. The sound design, the real action from fighter jet, the bloodpumping visual.

"Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman) is the resident of an high security facility in Estonia where she is a distinct danger to anyone who crosses her path! Rather gorily, she engineers a daring escape and somehow manages to get to the United States where she convinces Allen (Rossif Sutherland) that she is his long lost daughter. Well whilst dad might be fooled, the wife Tricia (Julia Stiles) and her son Gunnar (Matthew Finlan) soon catch on - but it seems that they have secrets of their own to keep. Can an uneasy truce prevail between them? Well, no - of course not but frankly I really couldn't have cared less. She is all too readily accepted into the wealthy American family (no DNA tests with her father to verify?) and as the story plods along, it loses any grasp on plausibility. We are required to believe that Esther is this epitome of evil, but the plot has more holes than a Swiss cheese so I kept asking myself just how any of this could ever actually happen - even in cinema land. It does have the benefit of being quite short, and to be fair to director William Brent Bell, he doesn't hang around once what passes for the story gets going. I just found the whole thing too nonsensical and the lead character had more of a petulance to her than any believable sense of menace.",CinemaSerf,5,760161,630cc47bb3e627007d45c05b,31243aa4-1a05-40d2-b388-846a07389ee9

"Nope, sorry! Didn't get the memo. This is just a mess. Uta is a famous singer who believes she may have the power to use song to unite the largely dysfunctional world against some marauding pirates. The world government and it's navy tries hard, but it cannot quite combat these ruthless and quirky characters - amongst whom she must count her own father Shanks. The thing is, though, that Uta and her slew of unremarkable power ballads strides two dimensions and gradually we begin to worry that she is perhaps not the altruist that it appears at the start. Perhaps she has evil aspirations of her own; or is being manipulated in some way? I am a big fan of Japanese animé usually, but this is all over the place. The story is weak and nigh-on impossible to follow with the characterisations shallow and almost non-existent. The supposedly cherubic voice of the young girl got right on my nerves from very early on, and the animations (except for, perhaps, at the end when the are lively and vivid) are almost comic book page-flicked in their delivery. Of course there is an inevitability about the ending, but in this case the journey to that conclusion is a maelstrom of confusion and un-engaging plot and personalities that left me cold.

"Long awaited and very conspiricized, **'Spider-man:No way Home'** Lives up and surpasses hype, The introduction of charcters once thought cordened off into the MCU, came both as a shock and as an eventual certainty. The Pleathora of indephth easter eggs creates awonderful viewing for the spider-man fan but alienates the casual none MCU fanatic viewers. The plot is dense not in fault but in advantage, it crams in expectation with suitable comedy and light heartedness. The director created a a comprehensive journey of emotion with several troughs and many peaks leaving a sense of WOAH at the end.Overall, **'Spider-man NWH'** is a Marvel Maniac's Heaven but can ruin marvel experiences for the uniformed viewers spoiling previous films and enjoyment of them.

"Wow! Loved it!I'd recommend not reading any reviews if you plan to watch it - I didn't and I'm sure glad I didn't! Spoilers inbound!Where to begin? I was not expecting to love this film as much as I do! It surpassed my expectations in every way possible, to the point that I'd say it beats <em>'Avengers: Endgame'</em> as my favourite production from the MCU. This is a next level superhero movie, it's easily the most I've consistently enjoyed a film in this series and genre - no question.The cast are all outstanding, it's ace how they work everyone in from previous iterations of <em>'Spider-Man'</em> - even away from the main universe. Seeing Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire together onscreen as Peter Parker is tremendous. The film does it in the perfect way, at no point does it feel forced or needless and the humour between the trio is excellent; in fact, the whole film is funny when it intends to be.Zendaya, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jacob Batalon (his best showing of the trilogy), Jon Favreau and Marisa Tomei also add positives things to this 2021 film. Jamie Foxx, Alfred Molina and, most pleasing for me, Willem Dafoe all reprise their characters from past releases and are all a joy. I'm a fan of Dafoe so was particularly happy to see him reappear.Onto what we see onscreen. The plot is great and I wouldn't change anything about it, there is one or two things that I had question marks about whilst watching but those quickly dissipated. The pacing is top notch and the music is superb, the respective screen times of everybody was pinpoint and, along with the already noted humour, the film also packs a punch on a more serious level to boot.This really is top tier Marvel! Would watch again, would recommended etc. Awesome!",r96sk,10,634649,61d7cd03a58902008b976594,47ca85bf-e916-48b1-8047-78a8547ead74
"This is the perfect Marvel movie that isn't an Avengers film. It pays off everything thing it builds up, corrects previous misgivings and really gets the character of Spider-Man right.

Good addition to the Spider-Man franchise and a quasi-reset. Fun seeing the old guard in here with Maguire and Garfield along with their foes and at least their inclusions didn't feel as forced as I feared when this movie was first announced. The relationship between Tom Holland and Zendaya worked better than in Homecoming and even Far From Home. Will be interesting to see where the series goes from here. **4.0/5**,JPV852,8,634649,62588a74c92c5d00652ee366,f2675487-1c34-4644-b99e-bd772cfba799
"This is another Spider Man for kids which for me is a wee bit unfortunate. I would very much have liked a Peter Parker / Spider Man that behaved like a real superhero instead of this naïve kid who constantly thinks he knows better than the grown ups and, of course, constantly bungles things up.In addition I was not too thrilled about the story itself where Spider Man right at the beginning is framed as the bad guy. I know, I know, it is rather consistent with the original comics but Hollywood do not hesitate so change things if they feel like it so why not make a good change for once?The good thing about this movie is the special effects. They are quite cool. Especially the parts in this weird space where Doctor Strange and Spider Man dukes it out. Unfortunately that is pretty much it.The rest of the movie is really dragged down by the childish and stupid behavior of Peter Parker. Him being a real idiot and constantly trying to change the spell was just cringe worthy. Then he continues screwing things up because he do not want notorious criminals to go back to their real place because they will actually die there. Typical Hollywood sob story. Despite what that dumb bitch said towards the end, yes Peter Parker you did something wrong, you screwed up big time and the wrong people died because of it.Another thing that was really annoying throughout the movie was listening to that moron Jonah Jameson from The Daily Bugle. He was spewing almost as much fake news as CNN and it just pissed me off every time he was on screen.It is a shame really. One would have thought that, given that they already did the young and immature Spider Man in Spider Man: Far From Home, they could have made him more experienced and mature in this one. You know, character advancement.Instead they just piled on the childish, naïve and immature behavior with a good dose of juvenile jokes making what, with some actual intelligent script writing, could have been a great movie with all those cool special effects (and I really do like Doctor Strange) to be one just barely watchable.",Per Gunnar Jonsson,5,634649,62b88a8767203d0d3888ba62,0adbf75f-506a-40de-8c0c-db177b82ee25

"**One of Marvel's absolute best!**Watching No Way Home felt like my childhood and my adulthood were embracing each other in a warm, friendly hug. The nostalgia was brilliantly balanced with advancing Tom Holland's Spider-man and developing his character. Andrew Garfield's Spider-man also received some long-awaited closure after an abrupt end to his story. The effects, action, and humor all reinforced a heartfelt film focusing on the characters' processing of loss and grief.",mooney240,10,634649,63002a45097c49007aa1e71c,24c9a7eb-743f-4741-bc76-d48bc68546cd
"Spider-Man: No Way Home is like the proverbial blind squirrel that finds a nut every now and then, except that it doesn’t so much find them as it steals them from another squirrel’s hoard. The massive combined gravitas generated by Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, and Jamie Foxx would be enough to save any other movie; the problem is that this film is not theirs to save, and it’s barely a film at all to begin with – it’s more like the superhero equivalent of that Pink Panther movie they made with spare parts from previous Pink Panther movies.If I want Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin, why not just revisit 2002’s Spider-Man? Similarly, if I have a hankering for Alfred Molina as Doc Ock, why not just rewatch 2004’s Spider-Man 2? The latter was, according to Roger Ebert, “the best superhero movie since the modern genre was launched with Superman”. How the mighty have fallen. It’s great to see Dafoe and Molina sharing screen time, but once the novelty – or rather the nostalgia – wears off, we are left with only a reminder of how comparatively superior Sam Raimi’s trilogy was, as well as a testament of how downhill things have gone since then.When Molina finally arrives, following an excruciatingly dumb, seemingly endless first half hour, he does so like a godsend; unfortunately, as much as we welcome the company of someone with a gleam of intelligence in his eyes, Doc Ock’s edge has been dulled by poor stylistic choices – first, his mechanical tentacles are 100% computer-generated (as opposed to Spider-Man 2, which used CGI to enhance, but not fully replace, a set of prop tentacles), and second, Molina was digitally de-aged (as was Dafoe), though in this case, unlike for example The Irishman, the unintended uncanny valley effect might have been a blessing in disguise; after all, Doc Ock is supposed to be a comic book villain, so that grotesqueness actually becomes him.All things considered, everything and everyone endemic to the MCU Spider-Man is as flat and artificial as cardboard (our sympathy inevitably lies with the villains because, goblins and octopuses though they may be, they remain at all times more human – and certainly have a cleverer sense of humor – than any of the heroes with the exception of Tobey Maguire, and while Spider-Man may prevail over Norman Osborne, Dafoe totally obliterates Holland in terms of acting); at the same time, all the best parts are almost exclusively lifted from the work – and not even the best work at that – of a much more talented filmmaker. To put it bluntly, Spider-Man: No Way Home has absolutely no reason for being.",JPRetana,1,634649,630ae8b432489b007e863578,e85e336a-d983-41a4-becc-0ad96ca25e0b
"_Halloween Ends_ is such a weird film, as a standalone movie I enjoyed it but in the trilogies totality it underwhelms and undermines. With each entry in this trilogy, the movies get farther and farther away from what Halloween is. With Ends there is no tension and no horror, there are some good kills but with nothing building up to it they felt stale. This movie also tears down Michael Meyers in a way that felt out of place in the trilogy. Halloween Kills built Michael up to be an indestructible force with the ability to withstand fire or multiple gunshot wounds, but in Ends that is flipped on its head making him weak due to the ending of the predecessor. It left me feeling like the writers had no idea what they were doing in developing this trilogy. The marketing of the movie was a total farce as well. It was building up to a final clash between Laurie and Michael, and while that does happen the majority follows a character that was just introduced (Corey Cunningham). Even though I really like the opening sequence and backstory to Corey, it had no place being centerstage in the final installment. Overall, this movie was slightly better than the sequel but still squanders the potential that Halloween (2018) had for the trilogy. If any more movies or trilogies are made in the future, please for the love of God hire a producer/writer to develop the entire series instead of piecing it together film by film.**Score:** _44%_ |**Verdict:** _Poor_",Nathan,4,616820,6349a612b7abb50081e7f296,4e2affa1-f487-4ab1-b5b2-0c6079ab6b20
"**Poor writing and a confusing story overshadowed a few shining moments and satisfying conclusions to character stories.**It’s so hard to choose whether I liked or disliked Halloween Ends. I enjoyed the resolution to Laurie Strode’s 40-year story arc and the hopeful journey for her granddaughter, Allyson. Even the final showdown between Jamie Lee Curtis and Michael Myers was satisfying, although the story didn’t build to the climax well. Sadly that is where the pros stop. The story was a convoluted mess that ignored all the build-up of the first two films and focused on a new character that didn’t matter to the overall story and didn’t have much impact on the film. As a result, Halloween Ends forgot what made its two predecessors successful and told a pointless meandering tale that had its moments but ultimately disappointed.",mooney240,5,616820,634aed83c8a2d4007a2fdaee,370aaa9e-7c14-402b-a638-3478d00abc75
"An unfortunate end, to a horror franchise, that started way back in 1978. Halloween Ends, is an inarticulate mess, that fails to build on past films. Instead, it delivers an incomprehensible story, that makes little to no sense, save that it brings the overriding story, to a somewhat confused, conclusion. On the upside solid acting and some tense, jump scare moments but really, its not enough.In summary, a reasonable cast in a poorly scripted film, that add's little to nothing that is meaningful, to the tale of serial killer, Michael Myers.",MovieGuys,4,616820,634ba83220e6a5007a6a3943,8db54526-c459-4b66-9446-2f1988e5f431
"It's a sad state of affairs when HALLOWEEN ENDS (2022) is being classed as a bad, terrible or disgraceful motion picture and I worry for cinema as a whole if the only direction the mass want is nothing but cookie-cutter.This film is a straaaaaaange beast and it probably holds the world record for the quickest development of a relationship on screen. Bloody hell, I wanted that relationship to succeed.I'm going to be controversial here... did we need Michael Myers at all here? Maybe the 2 or so scenes we get in the sewer early into the film and that's it... maybe pass the evil on and Michael die of his wounds.The evil is contagious element worked for me and Corey (played by Rohan Campbell) was the standout character.Issues? Yes, there are some - the narration and memoir aspect weren't needed and Corey's mum... erm, I'll leave it there.But I admire this film, oh boy do I.

"_Halloween Ends_ does provide what it promises and that’s a proper end to the Laurie Strode saga. However, the birth of a new rushed, hot-headed, and sloppier version of The Shape seems to take precedence only to be squashed before Laurie and Michael meet one last time. Entertaining at times and frustrating at others, _Halloween Ends_ is a bloody scenic route of a conclusion that is mostly satisfying despite its underappreciated albeit risky detours.Full review: https://hubpages.com/entertainment/Halloween-Ends-2022-Review-A-Square-Shape-in-a-Round-Horror",Chris Sawin,6,616820,634f4e13076ce8007a50f716,52bbba25-ec92-4c93-a0fc-3d307b65eb44
"Well there is a hewn-out pumpkin that looks ever so slightly scary... Otherwise, this is just one Halloween movie too many and it's only scream yells put me out of my misery pretty much from the start of this slow and plodding denouement to the franchise. Rohan Campbell (Corey) is bullied by some kids who end up shoving him from a bridge. He is dragged into the storm drains by you know who and emerges a man possessed. He has also attached himself to Allyson (Andi Matichak) who just happens to be the daughter of long suffering Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) and after a bit of hysteric family melodrama, all of her demons are flee-flowing and we are heading, slowly and ponderously to a conclusion that the best of which has already been seen many times in the trailers. This is far too long, virtually nothing happens until the last fifteen minutes and even then, there isn't even the vaguest hint of menace or jeopardy. The production is adequate, but JLC doesn't really feature often enough - as in Halloween Kills (2021) to make much impact - and the whole thing is episodic and smacks of made for television. Please let it be the final instalment - this bears no resemblance whatsoever to the original 1978 introduction to Myers et al.",CinemaSerf,5,616820,63511d36076ce8007a51b6bf,7d7509bf-5894-4360-95b6-7f99265b05e5
"Okay, seriously, when is the real Halloween Ends be released? What I saw for the bulk was some lame CW-like story. I have to think at this point David Gordon Green and the writer crew are just pulling a prank. I half expected a post-credit scene with Impractical Jokers...I don't even know what to say. I had low expectations going in given how much I disliked Halloween Kills but Ends didn't even meet the lows of the lows.

"**Smile’s creepy trailers and clever marketing were the best parts of a movie with a meager plot drenched in uneasy sounds, and way too many jump scares.**Smile obsesses over saturating every moment in unsettling dread. The score and sound effects make every moment uneasy and uncomfortable, and not in a good way. Smile’s premise bore many similarities to It Follows with much poorer execution. Smile stumbled from jump scare to jump scare. I started closing my eyes because the jump scares were so predictable, and I was tired of having disturbing images screamed in my face. I will say that Sosie Bacon did an excellent job with what she was given, with her performance being the only bright spot in the film. Unfortunately, the movie was unimpressive and tried to cloak mediocrity in a fountain of jump scares, stressful noises, and unpleasant moments.",mooney240,2,882598,63351984c2679600847bb34a,186303c6-3a93-40ab-9165-634ad4136bb5
"As an avid horror fan, I can genuinely say that Smile unsettled me beyond belief. In many horror films of today, directors rely solely on jump scares to create this sense of shock and horror. But in Smile, Parker Finn is able to build suspense and tension throughout a scene to then crescendo into a jump scare that the audience knows is coming but are so tense that they cannot help but to release into fright.While this movie does not break major ground in terms of plot and storytelling there is some depth that is added with mental health and the feeling of isolation during manic episodes. I felt for Rose throughout this entire film, as she used to be the one helping patients through mental crisis and now that she is having one of her own, she is met with the same doubts even though it is a genuine fear. The sense of hopelessness grows throughout the movie as hope drains from our lead actress.Speaking of our lead actress, Sosie Bacon is fantastic in this movie. She carries every single scene she is in, which is just about every one. Her minor facial movements and eye expressions were so sad and realistic to that of someone experiencing trauma. I loved everything about her performance and will be excited to see her moving forward. The other performances were average across the board, but they didn't really have a lot to work with and filled their roles well. Jessie Usher felt a little out of place though, I feel like he did the nice and charismatic husband role well but when he had to display genuine fear and anger he overacted quite a bit.Finally, I wanted to touch on the ending. I am not going to spoil anything for the audience, but this is exactly what I wanted throughout the entire film. I kept asking myself, are they going to do it? But second guessed myself and when the payoff happened, I left the theater with a big Smile on my face.**Score:** _75%_ |**Verdict:** _Good_",Nathan,7,882598,6349a527e263bb0084f27628,5423bc02-bfe4-4f9b-8be4-8fc5e78daf09
"Dr. Rose Cotter (Sosie Bacon) is a dedicated clinical psychologist who witnesses the gruesome suicide of a young woman in her hospital consulting room. Traumatised, as you might expect, she gradually starts to suffer from unexpected goings on in her own life. Her relationship becomes unstable and soon she appears to have but a tenuous grasp on reality herself. What's going on? Is she doomed to a similar fate? This has something of the Azazel theory to it, and as the story develops director Parker Finn manages to build quite a degree of mystery and suspense. The malevolence of her haunting spirit is well captured by those working the audio - the sound effects and the score contribute well to the overall feel of this film. The acting though, well I am sorry - I found that to be a terrible let down. Initially, Bacon owned the film but after a few moments she just hadn't the weight to carry the thing in what is, essentially, a one-hander. Her support comes mainly for her ex-boyfriend/cop and all round sceptic about the whole thing Joel (Kyle Gallner) after her boyfriend Trevor (Jessie T. Usher) and her own erstwhile psychiatrist played by an indifferent Robin Weigert give up the ghost with her. Sadly, they offer little to add depth to this rather superficial horror effort. There are jump moments, but they lose their potency as this actor fails to capitalise on the tensions being created around her. Perhaps had the story spent less time on her character development, and the pace been tightened up a bit then we might have had less time to worry about that; but the style of the photography with too many lingering images merely serves to sterilise the whole thing for me. I was really disappointed, and after a while just wanted to go watch Fallen (1998) instead.",CinemaSerf,5,882598,63525e254ca676007a52b46e,2bffd777-0f54-48e8-a6da-4c6be4521811

Sound design generates an immersive atmosphere rarely seen in horror films, but it turns out to be the moving, character-driven narrative that truly captivates viewers.The impact of past traumas is excellently addressed by a screenplay that glaringly fails to conclude the story at the most appropriate, thematically correct time - one of the most damaging endings of the year.Regardless, it's definitely a personal recommendation.Rating: B",MSB,7,882598,63591e85665408008196fe5b,3422e229-453e-40e0-9943-4ef33b9559fb
"So imagine the scenario. A boozy lunch with with some screenwriters who had just seen Vivarium (2019) and began to recall Stepford Wives (2004) and the Truman Show (1998). We know, say the assembled talent - let's write a pointless hybrid of these stories, making sure to avoid the best bits of any of them then get two gorgeous people to take part. We'll end up minted! Well they may well have ended up making loads of cash, but what they have provided for us is an heavily stylised story that goes nowhere fast. To be fair, Florence Pugh tries quite hard as Alice, the increasingly disturbed wife of Jack (Harry Styles). They live in an Utopian desert community where the men all head to work for Frank (Chris Pine) in the morning and the women do the standard middle class housework, shopping and networking things. All is idyllic until Alice notices that one of their neighbours Margaret (KiKi Layne) is convinced that something is amiss amidst their perfect lifestyle. When an inexplicable tragedy ensues, Alice starts to have nightmares and soon her marriage and his career prospects are in jeopardy. Pine isn't the least menacing as the duplicitous Frank and though the camera really does love Styles, he has little here to demonstrate whether he can actually act or can just fill a perfectly tailored suit as well as Daniel Craig. That's really the problem here. The film looks good, but the plot is completely undercooked. We are delivered of a partially formed plot that is derivative and, frankly, rather dull. The last few scenes with the guys in red reminded me of a television commercial for Vodaphone and at just over two hours long, I was just unengaged with it all. Styles' looks will take him far and working with the likes of Pugh and Pine will only help him, but unless his people work harder on the scripts and characterisations, then he will just end up Zac Efron-light. This is a film for television in due course, I'd say.",CinemaSerf,6,619730,633159ecd38b580092a8ca25,d14a031d-8c88-446f-9d1f-fd336900f428
"I thought this was great.I only knew of the off-screen drama about <em>'Don’t Worry Darling'</em>, thankfully I hadn't read or seen anything at all about the plot - which, obviously, helped my enjoyment. As such, I was extremely interested in the first chunk of this. It builds up nicely, revealing details here and there. The ending isn't as strong but I still dig it, don't get me wrong.The cast are terrific, even if Florence Pugh completely wipes the floor with her co-stars... and I don't mean that negatively on them one bit, it's simply a case of Pugh giving an outstanding performance. This is only the third film of her's that I've seen... gotta watch more!Away from Pugh, I was impressed by Harry Styles. He can act. I will say, though, that Shia LaBeouf would've been greater in the role though. Elsewhere, Olivia Wilde (also dir.), Chris Pine and Gemma Chan do good things.Is it a perfect film? Not at all. Is it entertaining? Sure is. Each to their own, but I thoroughly enjoyed this 2022 release.",r96sk,9,619730,6345c1a507e2810082f147f5,063ba5b2-5b29-43e1-8246-c9299f70e2e6
"It is no surprise that _Don't Worry Darling_ has been marred with public controversies and poor critic reception, but is it really bad as the media would want you to believe? While I admit, there are plenty of issues in the story department, like completely abandoning certain plot details as they are introduced or leaving certain character plots half-baked to name a few, the other aspects of this film really make this an enjoyable viewing experience.Olivia Wilde's direction is actually really well done here. I could tell that certain shots and elements were done with the specific intent to create a romanticized version of the 1950's while still giving glimpses of something sinister hidden underneath. Although it is a shame that these elements didn't lead to much in terms of a reveal at the end.The acting is a mixed bag here. Florence Pugh and Chris Pine absolutely carry this film. Pugh carries such complex emotions and is able to show her internal struggles while putting on a pretty face for appearance sakes. It is captivating and the audience can completely be resonant with her, this connection makes her character easy to root for. Chris Pine was really sinister in this role. I have not seen him as a villain in many shows and he does a fantastic job. For whatever reason, his mannerisms really reminded me of James Spader in Avengers: Age of Ultron, and that is a complement. Pine was not giving much screen time or character development, but he does the most with what he has. Olivia Wildes was fine, do not really have any complaints really, wasn't great but wasn't bad. Harry Styles' performance is hard to pinpoint. While I don’t think he did bad, but when he is constantly sharing the screen with Pughe, he is overshadowed a lot and his deficiencies show much more.Overall, I was disappointed with _Don't Worry Darling_ and the potential that was there to be such a special film. But it was still a good film that I had a fun time in.**Score:** _69%_**Verdict:** _Good_",Nathan,7,619730,6349a4a1414291009882333b,f24673a4-9776-4b2a-968e-4f11b0370706
"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/opinion-pieces/what-do-both-dont-worry-darling-and-crimes-of-the-future-have-in-commonPersonally, I believe that cinematic narratives with multiple plot points and questions related to the world itself are too often confused and envisioned as character studies driven by a single protagonist.Both Olivia Wilde and David Cronenberg complete their movies when the main character fulfills the minimum requirements of their arc, consequently renouncing all other equally significant issues worthy of in-depth exploration. In the case of Don't Worry Darling, one finishes it with an underwhelming feeling from an unsurprising conclusion, while in Crimes of the Future, viewers are left with several questions and interesting, half-developed paths about such a mesmerizing futuristic world.Neither film explores its own world-building satisfactorily.Rating: B-",MSB,6,619730,634bd53fe263bb009c4f9b55,8c8ae895-40d3-459d-b67d-a0a5d859b652
"**Don't Worry Darling has a lot going for it, but its script keeps it from being more than a pretty coat of paint on a mediocre story told several times before.**Don't Worry Darling is a new take on The Stepford Wives. Same basic story with some fantastic cinematography, great costuming, beautiful visuals, and committed, top-notch performances from the cast. But all that is lost in a script that gets stuck on coming up with as many ways as possible to show its characters' slipping sanity rather than telling a complete story. The plot twists were pretty easy to guess, and the finale ended abruptly without providing any conclusion or resolution for the character. With all the bright spots this film had to offer, the sloppy story squandered all its high points leaving me let down and a little bored even with an exciting climax. With that said, I'm still trying to figure out what could have been done to make this story more compelling. The Stepford Wives concept has been done several times before and seems always to fail to find a way to end with a satisfying resolution.",mooney240,6,619730,635b6386f28838007b158ae7,9d573c8e-61e2-48c8-b563-26041245bebb
